        <h1>The Post: Gen AI</h1>
        <p>Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI, GAI or GenAI) is artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images or other data using generative models, 
            often in response to prompts.Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate new data that has similar characteristics</p>

        <h2>All About GEN AI</h2>
        <p class="headline">Improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks enabled an AI boom of generative AI systems in the early 2020s. 
            These include large language model (LLM) chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Bard, and LLaMA, 
            and text-to-image artificial intelligence art systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, 
            and DALL-E. Companies such as 
            <code>OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, and Baidu</code> as well as 
            numerous smaller firms have developed generative AI models.</p>
        <p>Generative AI has uses across a wide range of industries, including software development, healthcare, finance, 
            entertainment, customer service,sales and marketing, art, writing, fashion, and 
            product design. However, concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of generative AI 
            such as cybercrime, and the use of fake news or deepfakes to deceive or manipulate people.</p>
        <p>But wait! What if you want more than just normal text on your page? Another common thing you might see in web
            pages are quotes. To make quotes, we can use the <code>blockquote</code> element and style it accordingly,
            so it stands
            out a bit as a non-body text quote.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote">"Jung believed that the shadow self is not entirely evil or bad, but rather a 
            potential source of creativity and growth. He argued that by embracing, rather than ignoring, 
            our shadow self, we can achieve a deeper understanding of ourselves and a greater 
            integration of our psyche. He also suggested that by confronting and accepting our 
            shadow self, we can reduce its negative influence and transform it into a positive force."

        <h3>a new section</h3>
        <p>And just like that, we've got a new section of content separated by a <code>hr</code> element (a 'horizontal
            rule' or a
            divider) and a new heading. Isn't putting content together fun?</p>
        <p>Notice as well that when we entered in the <code>H3</code> content, it was all lowercase, but now it's in a
            nice Title
            Case, where the first letter of each word is capitalized. We did that with CSS! Using <code>text-transform:
                capitalize;</code> we can implement title cased content.</p>

        <h3>Common Font Sizing Approaches</h3>
        <h4><code>px</code> (pixels)</h4>
        <p>Pixels are the simplest way to hard code your font size. By default the browser sets the root font size to
            <code>16px</code>, but you can change the font size in the <code>body</code> element or any other HTML
            element by setting
            <code>font-size</code> to
            any number of <code>px</code>.</p>
        <h4><code>em</code></h4>
        <p><code>em</code> units size font relative to the parent element. For example, if the <code>body</code> element
            is
            <code>16px</code>, and
            a nested <code>div</code>
            element's font size is set to <code>1.5em</code>, the browser will multiply <code>16px</code> x 1.5,
            resulting in <code>24px</code>
            font in the
            <code>div</code>.</p>
        <h4><code>rem</code> (root em)</h4>
        <p>Root <code>em</code> units are similar to em, but they are relative to the root font size instead of the
            parent element of
            whatever is being styled. For example, if the root font size (the font size of the body element) is set to
            <code>16px</code>, and we have a <code>p</code> element nested many layers down with a
            <code>font-size</code> set to
            <code>2rem</code>, that
            paragraph will have
            <code>32px</code> font. If the body font size ever changes, this paragraph will also change accordingly.</p>
        <h4>Which one do I use?</h4>
        <p>Great question! Generally, people try to stick to using <code>em</code> or <code>rem</code> over
            <code>px</code>, since they make
            responsive
            typography that scales up and down across different device widths much easier. Using px for your font sizes
            is not as dynamic, and you may find that writing media queries to update all the various element font sizes
            in pixels at different screen widths is not the most scalable approach to typography.
        </p>
        <p>Between <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code>, rem has a nice advantage of all elements being relative to one
            single root
            font value,
            where nested elements with parent/child font size dependencies can still be hard to manage with em units.
            When writing responsive styles, rem allows you to simply update the root font size at different screen sizes
            and all elements using rem units will adjust themselves accordingly creating a super easy-to-manage
            typography size system.</p>
        <p>In small projects you may not have an issues hard coding pixelage, but it's always important to understand
            the drawbacks of writing styles that may not be responsive or dynamic.</p>
